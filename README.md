The dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle.  
The Amazon Delivery Dataset is provided as a single CSV file named "amazon_delivery.csv". The file contains 43,632 rows of data, representing individual delivery records, and 16 columns as described above.
The file size is approximately 6 MB, making it suitable for analysis using various tools and programming languages. The data is organized in a tabular format, with each row representing a delivery and each column representing a specific attribute or feature.
The CSV file uses commas as the delimiter and includes a header row that lists the column names. The file is encoded in UTF-8 format, ensuring compatibility with most text editors and programming environments.  

I will do an EDA on it and look for insights that would affect the Delivery_time (in minutes).
